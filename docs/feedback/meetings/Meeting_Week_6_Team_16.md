# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization


Mark: Pass


#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I think the agenda looks good, follows the template, I like how it has the progress reports and recap of last week as well as sprint planning for next week.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The notes look great, good amount, clear, integrated in the agenda and contain agreements.


#### Chair performance


Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I think the chair did a great job at ensuring the topics of the agenda were covered and also covering them for an appropriate amount of time. Good job!

#### Attitude & Relation


Mark: Excellent

Feedback: I think you took ownership of the meeting and everyone was active / involved. The atmosphere was constructive and everyone's ideas / comments were taken into account.

#### Potentially Shippable Product


Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: I think you are on a decent track to create a good working application until the project end, but I do think you might need to push a bit more in the following week / weeks. As you will see, it will take some time to connect things (they will break / bug, you will have to refactor some stuff) and that is what worries me. But if you have good implementations it might not take too much to connect them ! 
Furthermore. you should be careful to match certain structure / code restrictions (have websockets in at least one place, have testing for the repositories though I see that you already started working on this).
I think if you manage to have the basic requirements by end of next week you should be fine. Keep in mind that week 8 and 9 will be quite stressful with the coding as you will get more busy and will have to polish your product. So try to make a lot of progress in this week / next week to have a good time in week 9.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: Everyone seems to contribute equally.
