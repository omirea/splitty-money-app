# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass/Fail

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 

Mark: Good

Feedback: The agenda followed the template it had a decent sprint review / sprint planning and the points were clear. I think an improvement would be to make sure the time tracking is on point.

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes have been merged into the agenda there is a good amount and they are clear. They contain concrete agreements.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: I think the chair did a decent job, it made sure all the topics of the agenda were covered. I think as an improvement firstly the chair should be more confident in his skills and make use of the chair position to speak up and organise the meetings (and not consider it a chore). Furthermore, a suggestion would be if the time tracking is a bit off to try to come up with some subjects and make the meeting productive for the team (as you still have quite a bit to work on).


#### Attitude & Relation


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I think you took ownership and that the atmosphere is constructive. Everyone's ideas / comments were taken into account.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: There has been project from last week and you did present the state of the application (somewhat). I think you are in a bit of a rough spot as a lot of your basic requirements are not yet completed. My suggestion would be to focus on them and to make sure that they work to the smallest detail and to work hard this and next week to achieve this goal. 


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone seems to contribute equally.
