# Meeting


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There has been a chair and a minute taker. 

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The agenda was added to the repository in time. It followed the template nicely and the individual points were clear. I like the concise format and while it did not seem like an issue for you I could suggest to maybe have some more details in them as the agenda can be used to the advantage of the chair to bring discussion points or to continue discussion. 


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes have been merged into the agenda file and there is a good amount. They are clear and realistic and they contain assigned people to tasks .  


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: I think the chair did a great job, it kept the discussion flow nicely and made sure the agenda topics were covered for an appropriate amount of time.  I would suggest as a general tip to try a bit more to engage directly people in the conversation by getting their opinion on certain topics as I think at times not everyone gives their input always on the question "what do you guys think", but overall great job! 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: I think the team took ownership of the meeting and I think everyone was active in the discussion. I think the atmosphere was constructive and everyone was listened and their ideas were taken into account. 
As a suggestion it would be great to get a bit more feedback on certain topics from everyone as at times it seems there are a few strong voices who give their opinions on all discussion points and there needs to be room for everyone as  it's good to have everyone's perspective.  

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: You presented nicely the current state of the app and the progress from last week. 
My only suggestion here would be to maybe present through the computer features that work completely and maybe some verbal communication for small features like a page and do the computer presentation for when features work full-stack as it will be more satisfying and nicer to see ;). But this is a small tip, overall you seem on a good track. 

#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team


Mark: Good

Feedback: Everyone seems to be contributing equally to the team.
