#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass

Feedback: There was a chair and a minute taker.


#### Agenda 


Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The agenda was added in time. It follows the template nicely and the individual points are clear. It is concise and clear, I like it, good job. Kudos for the topic at the start of the question, interesting format. 

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The notes have been merged into the agenda file and there is a good amount. As a suggestion might be good to note if there's certain people assigned to certain tasks.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: The chair ensured all topics of the agenda were covered and for an appropriate amount of time. I think the chair did an amazing job : lead the meeting presents the topics, use the agenda nicely to cover certain subjects and poke out people that are quiet to give input ! I also like the review of past meetings, great idea, it's important to discuss.  

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team took ownership of the meeting. Most persons were active and the atmosphere was constructive. The meeting went like a discussion which was great, everyone's ideas were listened to. Good job.

#### Potentially Shippable Product


Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The team presented the current state of the application and I think you are on track. There has been progress since last week. If you manage to finish some functionalities full-stack it would be great to have a small demo in week 6 to present. As a tip, try to not underestimate how hard it will be to connect back-end with front-end, the sooner you can get that to work the better.


#### Work Contribution/Distribution in the Team

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: The work distribution seems equal.
